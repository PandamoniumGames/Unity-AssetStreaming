# AssetStreaming

AssetStreaming was built to demonstrate how to handle world loading without loading everything into memory at once. For more details and explanations you can visit our [Guide to Asset Streaming in Open World Game](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/now-available-guide-to-asset-streaming-in-open-world-games-/). More documentation that explains the ideas and the approach behind this project can be found [here](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/po-assetstreaming/).

This codebase is availabale as a reference to help you setup your own asset streaming project. Unity-AssetStreaming is under the license found [here](LICENSE) unless otherwise specified.

# Licenses
The *[Demo Assets](./Assets/DemoAssets/)* used in this project are released under the *[Oculus Examples License](./Assets/DemoAssets/LICENSE.txt)*.

The *Oculus Integration* package is released under the *[Oculus SDK License Agreement](./Assets/Oculus/LICENSE.txt)*.

# Third-Party Libraries
In our implementation of the LOD Generator, we used a package from the Asset Store called [Mesh Baker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/mesh-baker-5017). We highly recommend using Mesh Baker to create texture atlases and combine your meshes. Alternatively, you could write your own or get a license for something like Simplygon.

For Licenses reasons we didn't include [Mesh Baker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/mesh-baker-5017) in the project.
